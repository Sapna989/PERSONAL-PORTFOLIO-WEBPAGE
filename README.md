This project is a personal portfolio website developed using only HTML and CSS, aimed at presenting my work, skills, and professional identity in a clean, responsive, and elegant manner. The website serves as a central platform to showcase who I am as a developerâ€”my passion, my projects, and the technologies I work with. The layout includes several key sections: an introduction (About) that briefly describes my enthusiasm for web development, a Projects section featuring key works such as an Interactive Quiz App, a Real-Time Chat App using React.js and WebSockets, and the portfolio itself, all explained with short summaries. There is also a Skills section that outlines my proficiency in core web technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, WebSockets, and modern responsive design techniques. The Contact section allows viewers to get in touch with me via email, providing a clear and simple way for potential clients or employers to reach out. The design focuses on smooth gradients, modern typography, box shadows, and hover transitions to ensure the UI feels interactive and engaging while maintaining clarity and ease of navigation. A sticky header allows quick access to different sections, and the site is fully responsive, adapting gracefully across screen sizes from desktop to mobile. The use of pure HTML and CSS highlights my understanding of front-end fundamentals and my ability to build a polished site without the need for external frameworks. This portfolio reflects not just my skills, but also my attention to detail and dedication to creating functional, aesthetic user experiences.
